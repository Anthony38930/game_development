# game_development

I got this idea when researching games created in Python. I was watching a tutorial on how to build the classic Snake game in Python. I decided to follow along with the video tutorial, writing my own code alongside this one, while making some subtle changes along the way.

Instead of having a snake eating food to grow, I’ve adapted the concept to be an alien eating planets and growing larger as it devours more planets. I may implement certain points scoring system, challenges and special abilities to assist the player, depending on the challenges I find along the way.

I start by drawing the game window, I’l be using pygame in this assignment, this is a tool which has been developed by the Python community, which allows the programmer to easily write codes by calling on functions created previously by the community and compiled into this library for a wider use.

After spending a couple of hours working through this tutorial, I encountered my first error whilst trying to run the game. I was encountering an ‘unbound local error’. This was frustrating and the code at first glance appeared to be all correct. After further debugging, I noticed I had forgotten the ending brackets when calling the block move class. After this was rectified, I was able to get my block moving across the screen when pressing directional buttons. 

During my time following this walkthrough, it has become apparent that I keep missing the Parenthesis. This I’ll need to be sure to double check going forward.

Working through the tutorial, I came across an error which I must of made a while ago regarding the collision. I mistyped whilst following the code and I was getting an error until I combed through the source code to see what the mistake was.
